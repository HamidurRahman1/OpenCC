## About:
This is a free and open source web application that notifies, via text, [LaGuardia Community College](https://www.laguardia.edu/home/Default.aspx) students when
their requested classes become open from closed. Students do not need anything other than a valid US phone number
to receive texts and that is all, nothing else.


## Platform, Build and Deployment:
This application will be deployed in Heroku.
