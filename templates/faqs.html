                &emsp;You can make any number of requests as long as you have not already made the same request. Please do not make unnecessary requests
                as it will delay the search, notifications you are expecting and potentially delay others to get notified.

                &emsp;You can do one of the following to stop getting text messages. Regardless of the choice you make, 
                a text will be sent saying that your requested class(es) have been deleted. If you do not get a text message
                that means you did not have a request to be deleted.

                    <h3><u>1 .Completely Stop Getting Text Messages:</u></h3>
                    &emsp;You can simply reply to the message saying: <strong>cancel all</strong>. You <strong>CAN NOT</strong>
                    write anything else before or after <strong>cancel all</strong>. It doesn't matter if the text
                    <strong>cancel all</strong> is upper case or not as long as the replied message only contains
                    <strong>cancel all</strong> (i.e you can still add requests and get notified even if you take this approach.)

                <div>
                    <h3><u>2. Stop Getting Text Messages for Only One Class:</u></h3>
                    &emsp;You can simply reply to the message saying: <strong>cancel [5-digit-class-number]</strong>
                    ex. <strong>cancel 45678</strong>. You can find the classes you requested in the chat. You
                    <strong>CAN NOT</strong> write anything else before or after <strong>cancel [5-digit-class-number]</strong>.
                    It does not matter if the text <strong>cancel [5-digit-class-number]</strong> is upper case or not.
                    <br>
                    &emsp;This is a convenient way to stop getting notifications as it allows you to stop getting
                    notified for a class that you have found a seat for, if you decided you will not take this class,
                    or if you decide to get notifications for the same course but a different section (i.e you can still
                    add requests and get notified even if you take this approach.)

            <div>&emsp;This application has a <strong>scheduler</strong> which runs every 2.5 minutes. The <strong>scheduler</strong>
                gets all the entered requests and search each request(class). If any of the classes are open then those who
                have made the request for this class will get notified right away in a couple of seconds. Keep in mind that if
                CUNYfirst is down due to maintenance then the application will not be able to search requested class(es) until it is back
                online. If a class becomes open right before CUNYfirt goes under maintenance, no one will be able to get that class until
                CUNYfirst is back online. Since the <strong>scheduler</strong> runs every 2.5 minutes, you still will have a high chance
                of getting this class if CUNYfirst is back online after maintenance.
